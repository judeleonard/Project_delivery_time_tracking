Troubleshoot common issues

- At boot, Airflow tunnels to default port 8080 and postgres to port 5432. Ensure there is no process running on these ports on your system, else airflow setup won't succeed. Ensure these PID processes are killed before initiating the setup-command.


Configurations
====================

The following configuration should be in place for this project to run successfully

- Ensure the sample_credential.json file is imported via the Airflow UI. This is to demonstrate privacy and not exposing secrets and sensitive data publicly
- Also create dbt connection id in the Airflow UI and fill up all the connection details using environment variables from the `sample_credentials.json` that connects to Airflow metastore.
